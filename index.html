Founded in 1959 by Drs Jagdish and Bharti Gandhi with the motto Jai Jagat (‘victory to the world’) based on the ancient wisdom of Vasudhaiv Kutumbkam (the whole earth is my family) and inspired by the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi and social reformer Sant Vinobha Bhave. Jai Jagat has been the school's greeting from the beginning.

The school places emphasis on children's all-round development through art, music, dance, drama, sport, debating, MUNs, international exchange with students abroad, the Junior Youth Empowerment Programme, etc.
